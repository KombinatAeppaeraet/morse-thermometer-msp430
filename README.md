# morse-thermometer-msp430
Very simple thermometer which uses LEDs to morse the
current temperature to you. Based on demo code contained in the Energia IDE.

It uses the msp430g2231 chip which contains an internal thermometer on the TI launchpad.

Programming is done with the Energia IDE (http://www.energia.nu), an Arduino IDE derivate for the TI MSP430 chips.
